The Python Weather App is a beginner-friendly, command-line application designed to fetch and display real-time weather data for a user-specified location. Utilizing the OpenWeatherMap API, users are prompted to input a city name or ZIP code. The API key, obtained by signing up on OpenWeatherMap, is essential for secure data access.

Through the 'weather_app.py' script, the application sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, incorporating the user's location and API key. The API responds with weather details in JSON format, which the script parses to extract and display key information like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

The project emphasizes fundamental programming concepts, including API integration, user input handling, and error management. Executing the script in the terminal or command prompt offers a straightforward user experience. This practical exercise provides valuable insights into Python programming, JSON parsing, and handling external APIs. Users can further customize and improve the app by incorporating additional features, fostering a hands-on understanding of Python development.
